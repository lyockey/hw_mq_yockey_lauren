# Media Queries
Adv. Web 2 - Due September 30, 2016

[Assignment GitHub Repo]( https://github.com/lyockey/hw_mq_yockey_lauren.git)

## Resources

[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
* I wasn't kidding when I said I use it for every assignment! For some reason it's impossible for me to memorize `.editorconfig` properties and syntax.

[HTML Color Picker](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)
* I always use the Color Picker when I need some handy hex codes.

[Git Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)
* I used this site to double-check that I was tagging and creating new branches based on that tag correctly. Still not 100% sure, but I think I got it right.

[MDN - Using Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#width)
* This is a helpful resource (and one you recommended) explaining media query syntax and properties. I mostly used it to verify syntax, especially for the `combo` branch.

[Canvas - Responsive Design Fundamentals](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/responsive-web-design-fundamentals?module_item_id=6205781)
* I used the Canvas page to copy the meta viewport tag into the HTML. The course page is also how I found the MDN resource listed above.


## Deductions

_I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus._

## Comments

1. Media queries are much less scary than I originally thought! I feel pretty comfortable with them now.

2. When I added the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` tag to my HTML, I did so to every individual branch -- is there a way you can apply a change (like this one) across all existing branches without having to merge? Obviously it wouldn't be necessary had I included it in v0.1, but I forgot about it until I already committed.
